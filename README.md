# CSProfHeads
Objective C app based on Candy Crush

This project was for my Programming Languages class. The app is based off of
the popular Candy Crush game. I decided to apply my own twist/humor to it by
cropping out certain Professor's heads from the CS department and replace the
cookie sprites with their heads instead. The presentation for the project was
quite funny. Also, this project is not my work alone, I have to give credit to 
Matthijs Holleman for creating a very detailed tutorial on how to build this app.
